I'm **Elizabeth Oneita Davis**, a Researcher in Community Engagement in the Conservation Science department. I lead the Illegal Wildlife Trade Program, a cross-organizational initiative to support local partners in countering trade and consumption-driven threats to wildlife.

I guide SDZWA's collaborative, multi-disciplinary Asian conservation work, and in my role I conduct research to inform behavior change campaigns to reduce consumer demand for wildlife in Southeast Asia. I work on every aspect, from the *design of surveys and questionnaires*, the *training of field teams*, the *analysis of the data*, and the *interpretation of the data* for lay audiences, scientists, and practitioners.

I am committed to capacity enhancement and teach incredible students and early career researchers across Southeast Asia. In the USA, I teach students in the Advanced Inquiry Masters Program at SDZWA about conservation social science.

I work with many partners including Vinh University, Vietnam, the University of Maryland, and Oxford University. As part of my work, I have interviewed women in Cambodia about their use of bear bile to treat pregnancy-related illnesses, and led a countrywide initiative in Vietnam to understand consumers of bear bile for medicine. For every project I work on, my aim is to compassionately understand the individuals involved and work thoughtfully and carefully towards effective demand reduction.

I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Zoology from the University of St. Andrews, and my doctorate in Anthropology at the University of Bristol. I am a firm believer in the efficacy of mixed methods approaches, cross-discipline collaboration, and empathy in conservation. I am an avid surfer, runner, cyclist, reader and video gamer.
