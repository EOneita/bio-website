I am the leader of the Asian Landscapes Hub at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (SDZWA), and a Postdoctoral Associate in Community Engagement at SDZWA. In this role, I guide SDZWA's collaborative, multi-disciplinary Asian conservation work. In my role as a Postdoctoral Associate, I conduct research to inform behavior change campaigns to reduce consumer demand for wildlife in Southeast Asia. I work on every aspect, from the *design of surveys and questionnaires*, the *training of field teams*, the *analysis of the data*, and the *interpretation of the data* for lay audiences, scientists, and practitioners.

I am committed to capacity enhancement and teach incredible students and early career researchers across Southeast Asia. In the USA, I teach students in the Advanced Inquiry Masters Program at SDZWA about conservation social science.

I work with many partners including Trường đại học Vinh (Vinh University, Vietnam), Free the Bears, Istituto Oikos, and Oxford University. As part of my work, I have interviewed women in Cambodia about their use of bear bile to treat pregnancy-related illnesses, and led a countrywide initiative in Vietnam to understand consumers of bear bile for medicine. I have also given recommendations for better biosecurity around wildlife consumption (believed to be the source of COVID-19), researched tiger bone glue consumption in Vietnam, and general wild animal medicine consumption in Myanmar and Laos. For every project I work on, my aim is to **compassionately understand the individuals involved and work thoughtfully and carefully towards effective demand reduction**.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Zoology from the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, and my doctorate in Anthropology at the University of Bristol. I am a firm believer in the efficacy of mixed methods approaches, cross-discipline collaboration, and empathy in conservation. I am an avid surfer :surfer:, runner, cyclist, reader and video gamer.
